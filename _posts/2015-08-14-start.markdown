This is my personal notes built against [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

I have written daily notes on evernotes for several years and waiting for their markdown support for a long while. But still no luck.

Finally I found GitHub pages and jekyllrb can give me what I want.
